/**
This class is based off a database I designed for the class COMS 363, while integration is something I do not know, the framework in which
the data base would interact with the backend is something I aim to build in this experiment.
When I learn how to integrate the database, I will do accordingly.
 Spring Data JPA already added as a dependency to this project



 this project is experiment on how to help interaction between classes and controllers and transfer data between them
